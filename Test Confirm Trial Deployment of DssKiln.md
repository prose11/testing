# Poll: Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the GovAlpha, Protocol Engineering, and Risk Core Units. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.**
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* Burn 3 million DAI worth of MKR as previously approved by Governance in June 2022.
* Proceed with the burn, but reduce it to 2 million DAI worth of MKR.
* Proceed with the burn, but reduce it to 1 million DAI worth of MKR.
* Proceed with the burn, but reduce it to 500,000 DAI worth of MKR.
* Do not burn any MKR using DssKiln at this time.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/poll-notice-confirmation-of-trial-dsskiln-deployment/19346/3) to help inform your position before voting.

Other parameters for the burn using DssKiln will be as follows:

* The sum of DAI to be exchanged for MKR to be burned will be transferred to DssKiln over 3 months using DssVest.
* `lot` - the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per `hop` - will be set to **30,000 DAI**.
* `hop` - the minimum number of seconds that mus pass before the `lot` can be sold - will be set to **38,880 seconds** (10.8 hours).
* `yen` - the ratio of spot price to the Uniswap TWAP price over the past `scope` - will be set to **100%**.
* `scope` - the time period of price date from the Uniswap TWAP against which `yen` will be measured - will be set to **1 hour**.

## Outcomes

**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the votes for that option exceed 50% of the total votes cast then that option is deemed the winner and the following actions will be taken:**
* If the winner represents a change from the status quo, this change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If no option has enough votes to exceed 50% of the total votes cast, we will proceed with the previously approved implementation.**
