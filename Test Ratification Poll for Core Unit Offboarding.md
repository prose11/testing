# Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP39c3-SP7 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*MakerDAO is restructuring in accordance with the Endgame Plan. With the rejection of our last budget proposal, we’ve been advised by the leading delegates that work related to our mandate would be better executed as an ecosystem actor or as an in-house function within other stakeholder groups. The rejection of our budget proposal did not come with a complementary offboarding proposal, so we are putting it up ourselves. This Core Unit should be formally offboarded to support the transition, formalize the status of the team, and provide any “golden parachute” compensation and retroactive benefits due to contributors.*

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for Option 1, Option 2, or Option 3 achieve a majority AND the votes for the winning option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
